# CPSC-314-Shader-Projects

This repository showcases a collection of small projects and shaders that I developed as part of my coursework in CPSC 314 - Computer Graphics at the University of British Columbia. Each project demonstrates my understanding and application of 3D computer graphics concepts, including mesh deformation and raycasting.

Projects Included
## Mesh Deformation
Creates the illusion of a trail following a sphere by deforming the vertices behind the sphere. Also has an additional mode where the same sphere gets mapped onto a plane allowing for the rendering of arbitrary shapes on the new surface.

## Raycasting
Implemented raycasting as my first introduction to shaders and GLSL. One mode draws an arrow representing the normal of the raycasting intersection point. The other mode takes the intersection of the cursor with the armadillo model and renders a level curve corresponding to the position of the cursor. The level curves can be drawn on either x, y, or z axis.

Key Concepts and Technologies
GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)

3D Transformations and Matrices

Lighting and Material Models

## About This Portfolio
These small-scale projects were developed for educational purposes and highlight my growing expertise in 3D graphics programming. While they are relatively simple, they demonstrate my competence in 3D computer graphics as I further my studies in the field.

I am constantly expanding my knowledge of computer graphics and looking forward to further refining these skills in future projects.

## How to Run the Projects
Clone this repository.

Ensure you have Three.js with WebGL installed.

Follow the instructions provided in each projectâ€™s individual folder to compile and run the shaders.
